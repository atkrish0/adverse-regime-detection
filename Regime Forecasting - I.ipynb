    "Business cycle describes the rise and fall in the growth of the economy that occurs over time. Each business cyle has two turning points trough (or bottom) and peak. Expansion is measured from the trough of the previous business cycle to the peak of the current cycle, while recession is measured from the peak to the trough. A representation of business cycles is shown in __[figure](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/baycollege-introbusiness/chapter/reading-the-business-cycle-definition-and-phases/)__ below. In the United States (US), the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) determines the dates for business cycles. The turning points are determined by considering monthly growth indicators of the economy such as industrial production, employment, real income. The main focus of business cycle analysis is to analyze why economy goes through contraction and expansion periods. It is a well-studied topic in the literature and still an active reserach area. In our work, we are going to predict recessions in US economy with leading macroeconomic indicators using machine learning algorithms."

    "Predicting business cycle turning points, especially economic recessions, is of great importance to investors, households, businesses in the economy.\n",
    "Starting from &nbsp;[Mitchell and Burns (1938)](#a) pioneering work,  analyzing indicators of business cycles have become a core research area in business cycle analysis and there has been many work done in that field since then. Much of the work in the literature has indicated a wide range of economic and financial variables contain predictive information about future recessions in the economy.&nbsp;[Stock and Watson (1989)](#b) established coincedent and leading economic indicators for recession forecasting. &nbsp;[Estrella and Mishkin (1998)](#c) have documented predictive power of the slope of the term structure of Treasury yields and stock market for US recessions. \n",
    "&nbsp;[Liu and Moench (2016)](#f) have also showed the Treasury term spread has the highest predictive power with lagged abservations as well. Also, they indicated that balances in broker-dealer margin accounts have significant effect on recession predictions, especially in longer horizons.\n",
    "&nbsp;[Chionis et al. (2009)](#d) worked on forecasting recessions in Europe with European Union (EU) data. They found out that the yield curve augmented with the composite stock index has significant predictive\n",
    "power in terms of the EU real output.\n",
    "&nbsp;[Ng (2014)](#e) worked on the problem through exploring effectiveness of boosting and found out interest rate measures and certain employment variables have predictive power for the recessions.\n",
    "Recently, &nbsp;[Huang et al. (2018)](#g) have worked on predictive power of news sentiment analysis on recession forecasting in US economy. "
